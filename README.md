## FACE RECOGNITION USING OPENCV - PYTHON ##



# INITIALLY, CREATE A DATASET OF FACES USING WEBCAM #
# EACH PERSON HAS A UNIQUE ID (INTEGER) #
# CODE ==> dataset_creation.py #


# SECOND STEP IS TO TRAIN THE RECOGNIZER USING THE DATA COLLECTED FROM INITIAL STEP #
# THE DATA FROM THE DATASET IS TRAINED AND STORED IN YML FILE FORMAT #
# CODE ==> Training_dataset.py #


# FINAL STEP IS TO RECOGNIZE THE FACES WITH THE TRAINED DATA #
# IMPORT YML FILE #
# GIVE NAMES TO THE UNIQUE IDS #
